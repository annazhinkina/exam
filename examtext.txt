I like autumn very much. The autumn months are: September, October, November.
In September summer yields to autumn. The days become shorter and the nights become longer. The sun rays are not so bright and warm. The fruit trees that not long ago bloomed with flowers are heavy with juicy apples and pears. Harvest time is a rush season for farmers. They gather sunflowers and maize, potatoes and cabbage, turnip and cucumbers, carrots and tomatoes. Early autumn is the period of flaming colours, when the landscape is gold and brown. In the daytime the silver gossamer is flying in the air. It’s a sign of the beautiful “Indian Summer”. But unfortunately this period of fine weather is very short and deep autumn follows it.
October is the best month for planting trees. People also prepare for winter.  It is a season when the trees are fantastic — yellow, red, green and brown. The trees are loosing their leaves. Now the ground is like a carpet of many colours. It gets dark earlier and often heavy clouds cover the sky bringing rain. Birds don’t sing their songs. They begin to leave for warm countries.
November is the month of fog, rain and snow. Animals put on their winter coats. The landscape becomes rather dull.Nature slowly falls asleep for winter.They say that  autumn is a season of poets and philosophers, that’s why I really like it.
